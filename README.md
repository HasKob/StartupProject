# StartupProject
A .NET 6 project that includes most best practices would typically be designed with a layered architecture approach, using Dependency Injection to decouple application modules and reduce code complexity.  The project would also use asynchronous programming and aim for low latency, high throughput, and scalability.

From a design patterns perspective, the repository uses the following:

- Repository pattern: The repository pattern is used to abstract the data access layer from the rest of the application. The Data folder contains the repository interfaces and their implementations for interacting with the database.

- Unit of Work pattern: The unit of work pattern is used to group repository operations together into a single transaction. The UnitOfWork.cs class in the Data folder implements this pattern.

- DTO pattern: The data transfer object pattern is used to define the input and output models for the API. The DTOs folder contains the DTOs used by the API.

- Dependency injection: The repository and unit of work classes are registered in the Startup.cs file for dependency injection. This promotes loose coupling between the application components and improves testability.

- Exception handling middleware: Custom middleware is used to handle exceptions and return appropriate responses to the API client.

- Swagger/OpenAPI: The API is documented using Swagger/OpenAPI specification. Swagger UI is also enabled for easy testing of the endpoints.
